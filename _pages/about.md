<p>I am a Ph.D. student at University of Pennsylvania in the Electrical and Systems Engineering department, supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. I am fortunate to be advised by Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti and Hamed Hassani. My current research interests are in data compression, information theory, machine learning, and networks. Previously, I received my B.S. at Cornell University where my focus was on signal processing and communications.
